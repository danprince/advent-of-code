;; Part 2 seems really tricky for day 5!
;;
;; The naive approach of actually generating the ranges of seeds and running
;; them all is likely to be prohibitively expensive (hundreds of millions of
;; seeds).
;;
;; Initially wondered about just passing the min/max of each seed range but
;; presumably middle values could map to a separate range that eventually
;; maps through to a lower location.
;;
;; Next idea would be to actually work backwards from the location map
;; to try and figure out whether any of the initial seeds would map into the
;; lowest value range, then the next lowest and so on. That seems tricky
;; because you also need to know whether there are any unmapped values that
;; could end up being lower.
;;
;; Noticing that in most of the maps in my input, there's a 0 source value
;; and a 0 destination value. Might be able to use these as a shortcut
;; through the mappings.
;;
;; For example, "humidity-to-location" has the following mappings:
;;
;;   dst       src       len
;;   857589555 0         114197007
;;   0         114197007 857589555
;;
;; This would mean the lowest possible location would be 0 and that could
;; only come from a humidity of 114197007. A humidity of 0 would use the
;; other mapping and come out as a location of 857589555.
;;
;; Doesn't seem like an accident that these ranges share the same three numbers
;; but I can't infer whether that actually gives it a useful property. It's
;; worth noting that it's only the final map that has this phenomena.
;;
;; It feels tempting to just work backwards from the mapping that produces
;; the smallest values, but if the mapped ranges overlap then the highest
;; mapped value from that range may be larger than the smallest mapped value
;; from the next range.
